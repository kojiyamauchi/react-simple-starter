## üßâ Continuous Integration.
- When Commit & Push to the Pull Request, ( Only Pull Request to `develop` Branch )
  - When There is a File Containing Test Code in  `resource/tests` Directory, Jest Will Launch.
  - Statically Analyze Code with ESLint. ( Before That, Husky & Lint Staged also Uses ESLint üí£ )
  - Test the Build at Every Commit.  

Launches Jest & ESLint & Test Build in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`  

„Éº

This Update Method's for Development by Personal Work ü§î  
To See Which Modules Can to Be Updated Which Version.  
Don't Use `yarn install --no-lockfile` and `yarn install --pure-lockfile`  
Because Want to Use Cache on GitHub Actions.   
When Development with Multiple People, Use `yarn upgrade`  
(Don't Remove `yarn.lock`, for Eliminate Difference in Version of Each Modules.)

## ‚úã TODO.  
- When Setup Browsers List, (In package.json or Add `.browserslistrc`) HMR's Does Not Work. üí£
- To Fast Up the Build, `ts-loader` has `happyPackMode` Enabled. (`transpileOnly: true` is Applied)  
So,  
> will not add type-only files (files that contains only interfaces and/or types) to the webpack dependencies set. Webpack watches only files that are in the dependencies set. This means that changes in type-only files will not trigger new compilation.  
-> <https://www.npmjs.com/package/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin#type-only-modules-watching>
- Styled Components V5's `createGlobalStyle` Does Not Work, When `@import`'s (CSS Import, Google Web Fonts etc.) Written Inside. For That, Use V4's Latest.
  - <https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/releases/tag/v5.0.0>  
  - When Use `>=5.0.0`, Use `React Helmet` & import with `<link href=‚Äú~"/>`
- @types/styled-components When Install Latest Version, @types/react-native's Installed Together.  
  Temporary -> Add `.yarnclean` Ignoring `@types/react-native`
  - <https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/33311>  
- Styled Components Autofix Stylelint Doesn't Work Yet.  
  Maybe Auto Fix of Stylelint Doesn't Work in Template Literals.  
  So, Display Only Warning on the Terminal.
